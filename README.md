# VoiceRecognition
Final Project of Concepcion, Delgado, Guinto and Medina in Electives 3

This is our project in our subject Electives 3 under Engr. Danilo Madrigalejos.

PUP BS Computer Engineering 5-3

Developers:
Concepcion, Julius Carl C.
Delgado, Joshua N.
Guinto, Marianne Elise R.
Medina, Mark Jason A.

Our system is a voice recognition system which switches on and off devices. We have set vocabularies in the program so that the system knows what to do with the devices.

We used the following phrases in controlling the devices:

SWITCH UP = Turns on the device
SWITCH DOWN = Turns off the device

We also assigned phrases to each device

ONE = 1st device (blue LED)
TWO = 2nd device (DC Motor)
THREE = 3rd device (red LED)


Further explanations and demonstrations are shown in the following videos in the link:
